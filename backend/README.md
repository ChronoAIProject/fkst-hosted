# fkst-hosted-api

`fkst-hosted-api` is the Rust (Axum) HTTP backend of **fkst-hosted**. It stores
fkst lua packages in MongoDB and runs [fkst-substrate](https://github.com/ChronoAIProject/fkst-substrate)
sessions on behalf of users. This is the v1 scope; this README covers **local
development** only.

## Prerequisites

- **Rust** (stable toolchain — pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`, which also pulls in `rustfmt` and `clippy`)
- **Docker** (for the local MongoDB and the integration tests)

## Local dev quickstart

1. Start MongoDB 7 (data persists in the named volume `fkst_mongo_data`):

   ```sh
   docker compose -f backend/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

2. Run the API (from `backend/`). `MONGODB_URI` is required — the server
   fails closed at startup if it is missing or Mongo is unreachable:

   ```sh
   MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017" cargo run -p fkst-hosted-api
   ```

3. Check health:

   ```sh
   curl -s localhost:8080/health
   curl -s localhost:8080/api/v1/health
   ```

   With Mongo up, both return `200 OK`:

   ```json
   {"status":"ok","mongo":"up","version":"0.0.0"}
   ```

   (`version` is the crate's `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`.)

4. To see the degraded path, stop Mongo while the API is running
   (`docker compose -f backend/docker-compose.yml stop`); both endpoints
   then return `503 Service Unavailable`:

   ```json
   {"status":"degraded","mongo":"down","version":"0.0.0"}
   ```

   Restart with `docker compose -f backend/docker-compose.yml start`.

### Host port 27017 already in use

`backend/docker-compose.yml` maps `27017:27017`. If another Mongo already
occupies host port 27017, change the **host** side of the mapping (e.g.
`"27018:27017"`) and point the API at it:

```sh
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27018" cargo run -p fkst-hosted-api
```

## Configuration (environment variables)

All configuration is read from the environment at startup (`src/config.rs` is
authoritative). Invalid values (non-numeric ports/timeouts, a zero request
timeout) are rejected at startup with a clear error.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | **yes** | — | MongoDB connection string. Missing → the process logs a config error and exits non-zero (fail-closed). Credentials embedded in the URI are **never logged** — the userinfo segment is redacted (`mongodb://<redacted>@host:27017`). |
| `MONGODB_DB` | no | `fkst_hosted` | Logical MongoDB database name. |
| `MONGODB_SERVER_SELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | `5000` | Driver server-selection timeout (ms). Bounds the startup ping and every `/health` check, so an unreachable Mongo fails fast instead of hanging. |
| `FKST_HOSTED_PORT` | no | `8080` | TCP port the HTTP server binds. |
| `FKST_HOSTED_BIND_ADDR` | no | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address. |
| `FKST_HOSTED_LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | `tracing-subscriber` `EnvFilter` directive (e.g. `debug`, `fkst_hosted_api=debug`). An invalid directive falls back to `info` with a warning. Logs are JSON. |
| `FKST_HOSTED_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` | no | `30` | Per-request timeout in seconds (`408 Request Timeout` on expiry). Must be ≥ 1; `0` is rejected at startup. |
| `FKST_AUTH_ENABLED` | no | `true` | Enable NyxID JWT authentication. Set to `"false"` for local dev (all routes open, extractor yields dev context). Default is fail-closed: auth is on unless explicitly disabled. |
| `FKST_AUTH_NYXID_BASE_URL` | when auth enabled | — | NyxID base URL for the JWKS endpoint (e.g. `https://nyxid.example.com`). Trailing `/` is trimmed. Required when `FKST_AUTH_ENABLED=true`. |
| `FKST_AUTH_ISSUER` | no | `nyxid` | Expected JWT `iss` claim. |
| `FKST_AUTH_AUDIENCE` | no | same as base URL | Expected JWT `aud` claim. Defaults to the (trimmed) `FKST_AUTH_NYXID_BASE_URL`. |
| `FKST_AUTH_JWKS_CACHE_TTL_SECS` | no | `300` | JWKS cache TTL in seconds. Must be ≥ 1; `0` is rejected at startup. After TTL expiry, stale keys are served if the refresh fetch fails. |
| `NYXID_CLIENT_ID` | no | — | NyxID service-account client ID for org APIs (e.g. `sa_…`). Both-or-neither with `NYXID_CLIENT_SECRET`. Without both, org features degrade gracefully (owner-only authorization). |
| `NYXID_CLIENT_SECRET` | no | — | NyxID service-account client secret (SECRET). Both-or-neither with `NYXID_CLIENT_ID`. |
| `FKST_NYXID_ORG_CACHE_TTL_SECS` | no | `30` | TTL in seconds for NyxID org-role and user-orgs caches. Controls how stale org membership data may be. Must be ≥ 1; `0` is rejected at startup. |
| `FKST_HOSTED_LLM_GATEWAY_URL` | no | — | NyxID LLM-gateway base URL (NyxID's `{base}/api/v1/llm/gateway/v1`) for `POST /api/v1/packages/generate`. Absent → generation is disabled (the endpoint answers `503`). When set, it **requires** `NYXID_CLIENT_ID`/`NYXID_CLIENT_SECRET` (the service account that mints the `llm:proxy` bearer) and `FKST_HOSTED_LLM_MODEL` — both are rejected at startup if missing. Non-secret (logged). |
| `FKST_HOSTED_LLM_MODEL` | when gateway set | — | Model name the gateway routes by (e.g. `claude-sonnet`). Required when `FKST_HOSTED_LLM_GATEWAY_URL` is set; fail-closed. |
| `FKST_HOSTED_LLM_TIMEOUT_SECS` | no | `20` | Per-request timeout (seconds) for one LLM completion call. Must be ≥ 1; `0` is rejected at startup. |
| `FKST_HOSTED_LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` | no | `1048576` | Max bytes accepted from a single completion before the draft is rejected and a corrective retry is attempted. Must be ≥ 1; `0` is rejected at startup. |

> **Deployment note (generation enabled):** the conformance dry-run runs inside
> the HTTP request, so set `FKST_HOSTED_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` to **≥ 90** when
> `FKST_HOSTED_LLM_GATEWAY_URL` is set — the request budget must cover up to two
> LLM round-trips plus the (≤ 20 s) engine conformance pre-flight.

### Claiming legacy packages and sessions

Pre-auth packages and sessions have no `owner_user_id` field and are grandfathered open to any authenticated user. To assign ownership of legacy docs, run a one-off `mongosh` snippet:

```js
// Assign all ownerless packages to a specific user:
db.packages.updateMany(
  { owner_user_id: { $exists: false } },
  { $set: { owner_user_id: "<user-id>" } }
);
// Assign all ownerless sessions to a specific user:
db.sessions.updateMany(
  { owner_user_id: { $exists: false } },
  { $set: { owner_user_id: "<user-id>" } }
);
```

## Health endpoints

`GET /health` and `GET /api/v1/health` share the same handler: each request
performs a real Mongo `ping`.

| Mongo | Status | Body |
|-------|--------|------|
| reachable | `200 OK` | `{"status":"ok","mongo":"up","version":"<crate version>"}` |
| unreachable | `503 Service Unavailable` | `{"status":"degraded","mongo":"down","version":"<crate version>"}` |

The ping is bounded by the driver's server-selection timeout
(`MONGODB_SERVER_SELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 5000 ms), so a dead Mongo
yields a fast 503 instead of a hang. The underlying ping error is logged,
never echoed to the client.

> **Kubernetes probe coupling:** a probe's `timeoutSeconds` must **exceed**
> `MONGODB_SERVER_SELECTION_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 5 s — so use e.g.
> `timeoutSeconds: 6` or higher). Otherwise the probe times out before the
> handler can answer with the diagnostic 503 body.

## Package API endpoints

All package endpoints require authentication (bearer token). Session
materialization uses **snapshot semantics**: sessions materialize package
files at spawn — a PUT affects only sessions started afterwards.

| Method | Path | Status | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/packages` | 201 | Create package (JSON body with `name`, `files`, optional `composed_deps`, `org_id`) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/packages` | 200 | List visible package names (ascending) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/packages/{name}` | 200 | Fetch one package |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/packages/{name}` | 200 | Replace `files` and `composed_deps` (JSON body; `created_at` and ownership untouched) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/packages/{name}` | 204 | Delete package (409 if active session or live lease exists) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/packages/{name}/archive` | 201 | Create package from zip archive (`Content-Type: application/zip`) |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/packages/{name}/archive` | 200 | Replace package from zip archive (`Content-Type: application/zip`) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/packages/generate` | 200 | Generate a package draft from a natural-language `description` (LLM); see below |

### LLM package generation (`POST /api/v1/packages/generate`)

Generate a validated fkst package draft from a natural-language `description`.
Requires the LLM gateway to be configured (`FKST_HOSTED_LLM_GATEWAY_URL`); when
it is not, the endpoint answers `503`.

**Request** (JSON):

```json
{ "description": "a department that greets every tick event",
  "name": "my-pkg",      // optional; a unique gen-<hex> name is minted when absent
  "save": false }         // optional; persist the draft as your own package when it validates
```

- `description` — 1..=8192 bytes (a `400` otherwise).
- `name` — optional; when present it must match `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$` (a `400`
  otherwise). When absent a unique `gen-<8 hex>` name is generated.
- `save` — when `true`, a **validated** draft whose conformance did not fail is
  persisted as the caller's own package; otherwise `save_error` records why and
  nothing is stored.

**Response** (`200 OK` — even when the draft fails validation/conformance):

```json
{
  "package": { "name": "my-pkg", "files": [ { "path": "...", "content": "..." } ], "composed_deps": [] },
  "validation": { "ok": true, "errors": [] },
  "conformance": { "status": "ok", "errors": [], "skipped_reason": null },
  "saved": false,
  "save_error": null,
  "attempts": 1
}
```

- `validation.ok` — the SAME `NewPackage::validate` gate every uploaded package
  passes. A draft that fails it is reported with `ok:false` and `errors`, and
  one corrective retry (with the validation errors fed back to the model) is
  attempted before giving up.
- `conformance.status` — `ok` / `failed` / `skipped`. The optional engine
  conformance dry-run runs only when the draft validates and the request budget
  allows; a raiser-only draft, a missing engine binary, or an exhausted budget
  yields `skipped` (with `skipped_reason`).
- `attempts` — `1` or `2`.

**Status codes:** `200` (generation ran), `400` (empty/oversize description or
invalid explicit name), `409` (`save:true` collided with an existing name),
`503` (generation not configured, or the gateway is unreachable).

**Trust model & privacy.** The model is reached through NyxID's LLM gateway
using a service-account bearer (scope `llm:proxy`); fkst-hosted never sees a raw
provider key. The LLM has **no tool access** and never touches the host — the
generated package is schema-parsed and then hard-validated by the exact gate
every uploaded package passes, so a **generated package is exactly as trusted as
a user-uploaded one** (it runs under the engine like everything else). The
caller's `description`, the prompts, and the raw model output are **never
logged** — only byte sizes, file counts, the attempt count, and the conformance
status.

### Zip archive upload

Upload a zip file as raw `application/zip` bytes (not multipart):

```sh
curl --data-binary @pkg.zip \
  -H "Content-Type: application/zip" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/packages/my-pkg/archive
```

Constraints enforced during zip extraction:
- Max 256 file entries (plus one optional root `composed.deps`)
- Per-file content: max 1 MiB
- Total decoded content: max 12 MiB (zip-bomb guard)
- All content must be valid UTF-8
- Root `fkst.env` is rejected (host-owned file)
- Root `composed.deps` is parsed into `composed_deps` (not stored as a file)
- Path rules enforced by `NewPackage::validate` (no `..`, `/`, `\`, control chars)

### Authorization

- **Read**: owner, org viewer+, admin scope
- **Write** (PUT, PUT-archive): owner, org member+, admin scope
- **Manage** (DELETE): owner, org admin, admin scope
- Foreign private packages return 404 (anti-enumeration)

## Testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace
```

- Unit tests and the router tests (`tests/health.rs`) run anywhere — no
  Docker, no real TCP bind.
- The Mongo integration tests (`tests/persistence.rs`) start an ephemeral
  MongoDB container via `testcontainers` and **skip cleanly when Docker is
  absent**, so the suite stays green on Docker-less runners.
